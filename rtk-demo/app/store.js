//higher order function
//1. First Function: (storeAPI) =>  it accepts storeAPI (an object with getState and dispatch methods) as an argument. But instead of doing something immediately, it returns another function:
//(next) => (action) => { ... }
//2. (next) => next refers to the next middleware in the chain, or the reducer if this is the last middleware. Once again, instead of immediately doing something, it returns another function:
//(action) => { ... }
// 3. Third Function: (action) =>action as an argument and then performs its work (logging the state and dispatching the action). This function contains the actual logic, but it was only reached after going through the first two functions.
